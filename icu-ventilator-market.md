<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ICU ventilator market can be divided into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver air directly into the lungs, typically used for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilators, conversely, provide support through masks or nasal prongs, suitable for patients needing assistance without intubation, often addressing conditions like COPD or sleep apnea. Both types are critical for managing respiratory issues in intensive care settings.</p></p>
