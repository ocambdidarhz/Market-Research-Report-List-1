<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EP Catheter Ablation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency Ablation Catheters</li><li>Cryoablation EP Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EP Catheter Ablation market consists primarily of two main types: radiofrequency ablation catheters and cryoablation EP catheters. Radiofrequency ablation uses energy waves to generate heat, destroying abnormal electrical pathways in the heart. This method is commonly employed for conditions like atrial fibrillation. In contrast, cryoablation EP catheters utilize extreme cold to create lesions, effectively interrupting faulty electrical signals. Both techniques aim to restore normal heart rhythm, catering to a growing demand in the treatment of various cardiac arrhythmias.</p></p>
