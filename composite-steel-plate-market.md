<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composite steel plate market includes primarily two fabrication types: explosion bonded and roll bonded plates. Explosion bonded plates involve a high-energy explosion to fuse dissimilar metals, creating a strong bond ideal for applications requiring high strength and resistance to extreme environments. In contrast, roll bonded plates are produced by mechanically rolling layers of different metals together under heat and pressure, resulting in a more uniform bond suitable for applications demanding ductility and formability. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
